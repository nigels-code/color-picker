# Color Picker

I wrote this while following Colt Steele's "Modern React Bootcamp" course.

A clone of websites like [Flat UI Colors](https://flatuicolors.com/) and [Material UI Colors](http://materialuicolors.co/?utm_source=launchers).

Technologies used: React, Javascript, HTML, CSS

## Installation
```sh
npm install
```
## Usage
```sh
npm start
```
This runs the application in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in a browser.
