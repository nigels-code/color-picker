# Color Picker

I wrote this while following Colt Steele's "Modern React Bootcamp" course.

A clone of websites like [Flat UI Colors](https://flatuicolors.com/) and [Material UI Colors](http://materialuicolors.co/?utm_source=launchers).

A Single Page Application using React, Javascript, HTML, MaterialUI.

I have connected this repo to Netlify.  
Open <https://colorpickerxx.netlify.app/> to see the project in production.

## Installation

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
npm start
```

This runs the application in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in a browser.
